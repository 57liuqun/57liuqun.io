:To see what you’ve changed but not yet staged
--- git diff

That’s because the -a flag includes all changed files. This is convenient, but be careful; sometimes this flag will cause you to include unwanted changes.
--- git -a -m commit "message"

 If you want to rename a file in Git, you can run something like:
--- git mv filename newname
