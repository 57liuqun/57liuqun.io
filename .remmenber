:To see what you’ve changed but not yet staged
--- git diff

That’s because the -a flag includes all changed files. This is convenient, but be careful; sometimes this flag will cause you to include unwanted changes.
--- git -a -m commit "message"

 If you want to rename a file in Git, you can run something like:
--- git mv filename newname

which shows the difference (the patch output) introduced in each commit.数字时限制显示的记录条数
--- git log -p -2

一行显示
git log --pretty=oneline

git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"
69abe97 - zxm, 11 minutes ago : 一系列改动

If you want to redo that commit, make the additional changes you forgot, stage them, and commit again using the --amend option:
---git commit --amend

git remote -v
查看已有的remote

设置remote
git remote add 名称 远程仓库地址

If you want to push your master branch to your origin server (again, cloning generally sets up both of those names for you automatically), then you can run this to push any commits you’ve done back up to the server:
--- git push 自己在remote时去的名称 master(主分支)


(要在外岑那个文件夹执行这个操作，不然会报错，且使用之前要用   --- git remote  -v确定一下远程操作的别名)
